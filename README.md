# GeoAccCollector
      This is a project that collects geolocation, orientation, and motion.
    The goal of this project is to detect non-smooth road with your mobile phone,
    using mobile web browser, such as Chrome in Android, Safari in iOS.

## Setup
      First of all, you need nodejs. We tried windows 10, ubuntu 16.04.
    Then, you need a database, that keeps the filtered data from web browser.
    
      With ``npm install``, you should be able to run this project as a website.
    Connect to the website, you are ready to go.
